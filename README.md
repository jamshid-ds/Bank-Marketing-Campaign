**There are many flaws in the data set. Nan had to delete several columns due to too many values. And the nan values in the remaining columns forced them to be deleted using fillna. These shortcomings caused the result of our machine learning model to be low. And at the same time, it proved important that the data is as clean as possible**

**This is the information we can conclude from the table:**
<br>

There is a problem with bias in the dataset representing the validations
<br>
Those confirmed are mostly in their 30-32s

**This is the result shown by the model (Gradient Boosting) that performed best against our test set**
<br>
<br>
<br>

**Due to data gaps, our model did not perform very well**
